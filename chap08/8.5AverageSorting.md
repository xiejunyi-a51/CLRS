Suppose that, instead of sorting an array, we just require that the elements increase on average. More precisely, we call an $n$-element array $A$ $k$-sorted if, for all $i=1,2,...,n-k$, the following holds:
$$
\frac{\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1}A[j]}{k}\le \frac{\sum_{j=i+1}^{i+k}A[j]}{k}.
$$

sorted in general sense

[2,1,4,3,6,5,8,7,10,9]
c.
It can be derived directly from the $k$-sorted definition:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1}A[j]&\le \sum_{j=i+1}^{i+k}A[j]
\\A[i]&\le A[i+k]
\end{aligned}
$$

Give an algorithm that $k$-sorts an $n$-element array in $\text{O}(n\log\frac{n}{k})$ time.

**Solution:**
Propposed algorithm as following,
1. Pick out every $k$ elements into a new group, starting from the $i$-th element respectively, $i=1,2,...,k-1$. It runs in $\text{O}(n)$ time.
2. Apply any $\text{O}(n\log{n})$ sorting algorithm on each of these $k$ groups. It takes $\text{O}(\lceil\frac{n}{k}\rceil\log\lceil\frac{n}{k}\rceil)$ time to sort each group.
3. Write back each sorted group of elements into original positions in $\text{O}(n)$ time.

Algorithm takes $\text{O}(n\log\frac{n}{k})$ time.
Algorithm is correct by definition, for $A[i]\le A[i+k]$ for any $i$.
e.
Show that we can sort a $k$-sorted array of length $n$ in $\text{O}(n\log{k})$ time.

**Solution:**
To sort a $k$-sorted array, again pull from original array $A$ $k$ smaller arrays of size $\lceil\frac{n}{k}\rceil$. From exercise 6.5-9 we know we can do $k$-way merging in $\text{O}(n\log{k})$ time.
f.
Show that when $k$ is a constant, $k$-sorting an $n$-element array requires $\text{O}(n\log{n})$ time.
 
**Solution:**
If $k$-sorting requires less than $\Omega(n\log{n})$ time, i.e. it only requires $\text{o}(n\log{n})$ time, then we can ordinarily sort an $n$-element array by first $k$-sorting it and then sort the $k$-sorted array as in (e). Two steps should take $\text{o}(n\log{n})+\text{O}(n\log{k})$, which is below proven comparison sort lower bound: $\text{O}(n\log{n})$. Therefore $k$-sorting takes at least $\Omega(n\log{n})$ time.
