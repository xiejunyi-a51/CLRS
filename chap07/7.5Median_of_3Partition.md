Median-of-3 method affects only the partition result not the partition effort $\Theta(n)$ each time. Even with best partition, recursion tree has depth $\Theta(\log{n})$ resulting in $\Omega(n\log{n})$ quicksort running time. Therefore Median-of-3 method affects only constant factor of time complexity.
