Equal keys pose a problem for the implementation of binary search trees.

a. What is the asymptotic performance of TREE-INSERT when used to insert n items with identical keys into an initially empty binary search tree? 
**Solution:** O($n^2$). Because they would form an actual linked list.
We propose to improve TREE-INSERT by testing before line 5 to determine whether z.key=x.key and by testing before line 11 to determine whether z.key=y.key.

If equality holds, we implement one of the following strategies. For each strategy, find the asymptotic performance of inserting n items with identical keys into an initially empty binary search tree. (The strategies are described for line 5, in which we compare the keys of z and x. Substitute y for x to arrive at the strategies for line 11.)

b. Keep a boolean flag x.b at node x, and set x to either x.left or x.right based on the value of x.b, which alternates between FALSE and TRUE each time we visit x while inserting a node with the same key as x.
**Solution:** O($n\log n$).

c. Keep a list of nodes with equal keys at x, and insert z into the list.
**Solution:** O($n$).

d. Randomly set x to either x.left or x.right. (Give the worst-case performance and informally derive the expected running time.)
**Solution:** worst-case time is O($n^2$) as in (a), expected time is O($n\log n$).
