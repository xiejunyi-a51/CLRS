Proposed Algorithm:
1. compare each element $A[i]$ in the left half of input $AL$ with its pair $A[i+\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor]$ in right half of array $AR$ and swap if $A[i] < A[i+\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor]$.
2. make each element in $AR$ remember its larger counterpart for later.
3. use a linear time algorithm to find $i$-th order statistic $x$ in $AR$ then partition $AR$ using $x$ as pivot. Now since every element to the right of $x$ in $AR$ and the pair of them are larger than or equal to $x$, the real $i$-th order statistic of $A$ must be one of $j$-th($1\le j\le i$) element of $AR$ or their pair.
4. find $i$-th element in selected $2i$ elements.
