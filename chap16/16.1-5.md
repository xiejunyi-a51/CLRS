Consider a modification to the activity-selection problem in which each activity $a_i$ has, in addition to a start and finish time, a value $v_i$ . The objective is no longer to maximize the number of activities scheduled, but instead to maximize the total value of the activities scheduled. That is, we wish to choose a set $A$ of compatible activities such that $\sum_{a_k\in A}v_k$ is maximized. Give a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem.

$$
A_{ij}=\max_{i+1 \le k \le j-1}A_{ik} .v+a_k.v + A_{kj}.v
$$

$A_{ij}$ represents maximum-value subset of non-overlapping activities that happen after $a_i.finish$ and before $a_j.start$.

**Better Version:**

$$
A_i=\max\{A_{i-1}, A_{\max{j|a_j.f<=a_i.s}}\cup\{a_i\}\}
$$

$A_{i}$ represents maximum-value subset of non-overlapping activities in subset $a_1,...,a_i$ ordered by finishing time.
