Prove Corollary 24.3
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a weighted, directed graph with source vertex $s$ and weight function $w:E \rightarrow R$, and assume that $G$ contains no negative-weight cycles that are reachable from $s$. Then, for each vertex $v\in V$ , there is a path from $s$ to $v$ if and only if BELLMAN-FORD terminates with $v.d < \infty$ when it is run on $G$.

**Solution:**
$\Rightarrow$ it's already proven by Lemma 24.2

$\Leftarrow$ If $v.d < \infty$. $v.d$ only changes under relaxation. Since $v.d$ is initialized to $\infty$, there must be some $u,u.d < \infty$ such that when relaxing $(u,v)$ $v.d=u.d+w(u,v)$. Thus Therefore $v$ is reachable.

### 24.1-3
Instead of doing exact $m$ iterations, if in any iteration no edge gets relaxed(no $v.d,v\in V$ gets updated), break the loop and algorithm returns TRUE.

```C++
bellman-ford(G,w,s):
    initialize_single_source(G,s)
    for i = 1 to |G.V| - 1:
        bool chgd = false
        for each edge (u,v) in G.E:
            if v.d > u.d + w(u,v):
                v.d = u.d + w(u,v)
                v.pi = u
                chgd = true
        if not chgd:
            return true
    for each edge (u,v) in G.E:
        if v.d > u.d + w(u,v):
            return false
    return true
```

### 24.1-4
Modify the Bellman-Ford algorithm so that it sets $v.d=- \infty$ for all vertices $v$ for which there is a negative-weight cycle on some path from the source to $v$.

**Solution:**
Every negtive-weight cycle must contain a *witness:* a vertex $v$ that does not satisfy $v.d \le u.d + w(u,v)$ for some edge $(u,v)$. Therefore in the last iteration keep a record for every *witness*, then find every vertex reachable from $witnesses$ and assign $d=- \infty$.
It takes $\text{O}(E)$ to perform addtional dfs for all *witnesses*.

```C++
bellman-ford(G,w,s):
    initialize_single_source(G,s)
    for i = 1 to |G.V| - 1:
        bool chgd = false
        for each edge (u,v) in G.E:
            if v.d > u.d + w(u,v):
                v.d = u.d + w(u,v)
                v.pi = u
                chgd = true
        if not chgd:
            return true
    witnesses = {}
    for each edge (u,v) in G.E:
        if v.d > u.d + w(u,v):
            witnesses.insert(v)
    for each u in witnesses:
        if u.d != -∞:
            dfs(G,u,mark)
    return witnesses.empty()

dfs(G,v,visited):
    v.d = -∞
    for each u in G.Adj[v]:
        if u.d != -∞:
            dfs(G,u,visited)
```

### 24.1-5
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function $w:E \rightarrow R$. Give an $\text{O}(|V||E|)$-time algorithm to find, for each vertex $v\in V$ , the value

$$
\delta^{*}(v)=\min_{u\in V}\delta(u,v)
$$

**Solution:**
To compute $\delta^{*}(v)$, we need to consider every shortest path that leads to $v$.

Initialize for each vertex $v\in V$, $u.d = 0$.
Change relex operation to

$$
v.d = \min\{v.d,w(u,v),u.d+w(u,v)\}.
$$


(This is equivalent to initializing 
each $v.d$ to $\min w(u,v)$ then adopt same old relax operation.)

Then If there exist some shortest path $s \stackrel{p}\leadsto v, s\in V$, we know $p$ and $\delta(s,v)$ will be accounted for while computing $\delta^{*}(v)$.

**Proof**
Let $s \leadsto u \rightarrow v, s\in V$ be any shortest path in G. If $u.d \le \delta(s,u)$ at any time prior to calling $\text{relax}(u,v)$, then $v.d \le \delta(s,v)$ at all times after the call.

$$
\begin{aligned}
v.d &\le u.d + w(u,v)\text{     lemma 24.13}\\
&\le \delta(s,u) + w(u,v)\\
&=\delta(s,v)\text{ shortest path optimal sub-structure}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$\Rightarrow$ Since for any finite shortest path $s \leadsto v$, $s.d$ is initialized to 0, we know $v.d\le \delta(s,v)$ after $|V|-1$ iterations.

Now we show $v.d$ is upper bound for $\delta^{*}(v)$.

*Inductive hypothesis:* $v.d \ge \delta^{*}(v)$.
*Base case:* At initialization clearly $\min w(u,v) \ge \min_{u\in V}\delta(u,v)$.
*Inductive step:* relaxation of edge $(u,v)$. $v.d$ and $u.d$ satisfy upper bound before relaxation. If $v.d$ changes, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
v.d &= u.d + w(u,v)\\
&\ge \delta^{*}(u) + w(u,v)\\
&=\min_{w\in V}\delta(w,u)+w(u,v)\\
&=\min_{w\in V}(\delta(w,u)+w(u,v))\\
&\ge \min_{w\in V}\delta(w,v)
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore invariant is maintained.

$$
v.d\le \delta(u,v), u\in V \Rightarrow
v.d \le \min_{u\in V}\delta(u,v),\\
v.d\ge \min_{u\in V}\delta(u,v)\Rightarrow
v.d = \min_{u\in V}\delta(u,v).
$$

### 24.1-6
Suppose that a weighted, directed graph $G=(V,E)$ has a negative-weight cycle. Give an efficient algorithm to list the vertices of one such cycle. Prove that your algorithm is correct.

**Solution:**
Step 1. Choose any witness found in bellman-ford proposed in 24.1-4.
Step 2. Perform dfs on witness, keep the distance of current path. If at some point dfs reach start witness vertex and current distance is negtive, return the list of vertices on current path.
Step 3. repeat Step 1 until one negative-weight cycle found.

**Proof**
Every negative-wight cycle must contain a witness vertex $v$($v.d > u.d + w(u,v)$ for some $u\in V$); A witness vertex is not necessarily in a negative-wight cycle.
