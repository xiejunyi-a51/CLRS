Let random variable $P(T_n)$ denode the total depth of a n-nodes tree. 
$$
P(T_0) = P(T_1) = 0.
$$
$I_i$ = {0, 1}, $i=0,1,...,n-1$ is indicator variable that the $i$-th node gets picked as root.
$$
P(T_n) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}I_i(P(T_i)+P(T_{n-i-1})) + n-1.
$$
The selection of root has no effect on the total depth of left- and right subtree, which only depends on their number of nodes and shape. Therefore $I_i$ and $P(T_i)$ are independent.
$$
P(n) = \mathbf E[P(T_n)] \\
=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\mathbf E[I_i(P(T_i)+P(T_{n-i-1}))] + n-1 \\
=n-1+\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\mathbf E[I_iP(T_i)]+\mathbf E[I_iP(T_{n-i-1})]\\
=n-1+\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\mathbf E[I_i]\mathbf E[P(T_i)]+\mathbf E[I_i]\mathbf E[P(T_{n-i-1})]\\

= n-1+ {1 \over n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}P(i)+P(n-i-1)
\\
= {2 \over n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}P(i)+\Theta(n)

f. Always take the first element as pivot and make sure when partioning, relative order of any two elements except for the pivot remain the same.
