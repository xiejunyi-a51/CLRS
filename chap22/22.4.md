### 22.4-3
**Solution:**
Alogirithm:
1. If the graph has $|E|\ge |V|$, then it must contain loops.
2. Else for each edge mark the two end vertices visited. If in the end $|E|$ is greater than or equal to the number of visited vertices, the graph contains loop. Otherwise graph is acyclic.

### 22.4-5
**Solution:**
We will maintain a hashmap $H$ to record indegrees of every vertex. We also keep a set $S$ of all vertices with indegrees 0.

To implement topological sort:
1. we traverse $G.adj$ to count indegrees for each vertex. It takes $\text{O}(V+E)$ to count indegrees. Then put in $S$ those with indegrees 0.
2. while $S$ is not empty, extract one vertex $u$ from $S$, $u$ is before every left vertices in topological sort result. For each vertex $v$ in $G.adj[u]$, decrease its indegree by one: $H[v]=H[v]-1$. If $H[v]$ reaches 0, put $v$ into $S$. Aggregately, $H[v]=H[v]-1$ is executely $|E|$ times.
3. Repeat step 2 until $S$ is empty.

**Correctness**:
Graph has topological sort order if and only it does not contain cycles. For DAG, we can must find vertices with indegree 0.
**Complexity**
Algorithm takes total time $\text{O}(V+E)$.

If there is ever a cycle in $G$, at some point algorithm can't find vertices with 0 indegree in graph.
