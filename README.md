CLRS Problem Solving Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the problems in the book Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.

Introduction

I created this project as a way to deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures. Additionally, I wanted to create a resource for others who are also studying the book and may benefit from seeing different solutions to the problems.

Contents

The repository is organized by chapter, and each chapter contains its corresponding solutions mostly without problem description from book. I have tried to write down most algorithms in natural languages rather than code Because it's important that we can communicate ideas and algorithms in a comprehensive manner to others instead of computers. However, I do use pseudocode and occasionally C++ code when it just looks like a leetCode question and I spontaneously feel like coding..

6.006 Folder

In addition to the CLRS problems, I have also included my answers to sessions and quizzes from MIT's 6.006 course in a separate folder. 

Warning

I may skip some starghtforwrd problems to save typing efforts..

Cross-Checking Answers

To ensure the accuracy of my solutions, I have cross-checked my answers with walkccc's solutions when completing each problem set. See https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS for an incredible nearly complete solution manual.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you find it useful in your own learning!
