## Coin Changing
Let $coins$ represent coins of different denominations and $n$ represent a total amount of money. Compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up exactly that amount.

Coin change problem in general requires dynamic programming. Let $c[i]$ be the fewest number of coins that you need to make up amount of money $i$. $c[i]=\infty$ represents no change can be made.

$$
c[i] = \min(\infty,\min_{j\in coins,j\le i}1+c[i-j])
\\
c[0]=0
$$

Time Complexity is $|coins|\cdot n$.

### Prove Greedyness For specific Coins Input [by induction on x]
$coins=[1,5,10,25,100]$.

**Properties of optimal solution**
1. *Property.* Number of pennies ≤ 4. 
*Pf.* Replace 5 pennies with 1 nickel.
2. *Property.* Number of nickels ≤ 1. 
3. *Property.* Number of quarters ≤ 3.
4. *Property.* Number of nickels + number of dimes ≤ 2. 
*Pf.*
- Replace 3 dimes and 0 nickels with 1 quarter and 1 nickel; 
- Replace 2 dimes and 1 nickel with 1 quarter.
- Recall: at most 1 nickel.

Consider optimal way to change $c_k ≤ x < c_k+1$ : greedy takes coin $c_k$. We claim that any optimal solution must also take coin $c_k$.
- if not, it needs enough coins of type $c_1, ..., c_{k–1}$ to add up to $x$
- table below indicates no optimal solution can do this 
- Problem reduces to coin-changing $x – c_k$ cents, which, by induction,
is optimally solved by greedy algorithm.

|$c_k$|optimal solution  property | max value of coins $c_1, ..., c_{k–1}$ in any optimal solution|
|---|---|---|
1   |$P\le4$|-
5   |$N\le1$|4
10  |$N+D\le2$|9
25  |$Q\le3$|24
100 |-|99
