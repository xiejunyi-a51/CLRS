a. Prove that in a breadth-first search of an undirected graph, the following properties hold:
1. There are no back edges and no forward edges.
It's not possible to exist a back edge from $u$ to ancestor $v$. since $(v,u)$ must have already been identified as tree edge when processing ancestor $v$.
;
$\text{descendant}(u).d > u.d$ When processing $u$, its descendant has not been visited. Therefore no forward edges.
2. For each tree edge $(u, v)$, we have $v.d = u.d + 1$.
$\text{child}(u).d = u.d+1$
3. For each cross edge $(u, v)$, we have $v.d = u.d$ or $v.d = u.d + 1$.
$v$ is either before $u$ and already popped out of $Q$, or currently in $Q$: $v.d \le u.d + 1$.
Furthermore $u$'s parent must have been processed before $v$ otherwise $u$ would be $v$'s child: $u.d-1\le v.d\Rightarrow v.d \ge u.d - 1$. In that case $v$ has same discovery time as $u$'s parent, $(v,u)$ would have been classified as cross edge when processing $v$. Therefore cross edge never points to smaller discovery time.

b. Prove that in a breadth-first search of a directed graph, the following properties hold:
1. There are no forward edges.
$\text{descendant}(u).d > u.d$ When processing $u$, its descendant has not been visited. Therefore no forward edges.
2. For each tree edge $(u, v)$, we have $v.d = u.d + 1$.
$\text{child}(u).d = u.d+1$
3. For each cross edge $(u, v)$, we have $v.d \le u.d + 1$.
$v$ is either before $u$ and already popped out of $Q$, or currently in $Q$.
4. For each back edge $(u, v)$, we have $0 \le v.d \le u.d$.
$\text{ancestor}(u).d < u.d$
