### 22-4 Reachability ‚≠ê
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed graph in which each vertex $u\in V$ is labeled with a unique integer $L(u)$ from the set $\{1,2,..,|V|\}$. For each vertex $u\in V$, let $R(u)=\{v\in V: u\leadsto v\} be the set of vertices that are reachable from $u$. Define $\min(u)$ to be the vertex in $R(u)$ whose label is minimum, i.e., $\min(u)$ is the vertex $v$ such that $L(v)=\min\{L(w):w\in R(u)\}$. Give an $\text{O}(V+E)$-time algorithm that computes $\min(u)$ for all vertices $u\in V$.

**Solution:**
Proposed Algorithm
Step 1: Partition the graph by strongly connected components.

Step 2.1: Initialize each vertex $v_i$ in $G^{SCC}$ with $min(v_i)=\min\{L(u)|u\in SCC_i\}$

Step 2.2: Perform dynamic programming on DAG $G^{SCC}$, where

$$
\min(v_i)=\min\{\min(v_i),\min(w)\},\quad v_i\in G^{SCC}.V,w\in G^{SCC}.Adj[v_i]
$$

Time complexity for dynamic programming is proportional to $|G^{SCC}.E|$.

Step 3: Within each SCC, assign every vertex with value of corresponding $min(v_i)$.
