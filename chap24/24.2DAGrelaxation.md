Alogirithm:
```C++ 
countPaths(G):
    topological sort graph G
    v.p = 0 for v in G.V
    for each verte v in topological sorted order:
        for each vertex u in Adj[v]:
            u.p = u.p + v.p + 1
    return sum(v.p) for v in G.V
```
$v.p$ repressents number of paths ending at vertex $v$.
Topological sort takes $\text{O}(V+E)$; for loop traverses each vertex and edge exactly once. Together algorithm takes only $\text{O}(V+E)$.
