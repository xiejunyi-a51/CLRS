**Solution:**
Proposed Algorithm
Step 1: Partition the graph by strongly connected components.

Step 2.1: Initialize each vertex $v_i$ in $G^{SCC}$ with $min(v_i)=\min\{L(u)|u\in SCC_i\}$

Step 2.2: Perform dynamic programming on DAG $G^{SCC}$, where

$$
\min(v_i)=\min\{\min(v_i),\min(w)\},\quad v_i\in G^{SCC}.V,w\in G^{SCC}.Adj[v_i]
$$

Time complexity for dynamic programming is proportional to $|G^{SCC}.E|$.

Step 3: Within each SCC, assign every vertex with value of corresponding $min(v_i)$.
