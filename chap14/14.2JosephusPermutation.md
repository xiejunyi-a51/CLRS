a.
Put integers $1..n$ into a linked list. Starting from 1, remove every $m$-th node until list is empty. It takes $\text{O}(mn)=\text{O}(n)$ time.
b.
Make an order-statistic tree with keys $1..n$. Each time we remove the $m$-th order node in $\text{O}(\log{n})$ time. In the end we have Josephus perputation in $\text{O}(n\log{n})$ time.
