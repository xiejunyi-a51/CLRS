**Key**
find_intersection makes sure each element in $A$ is eithr to the left or right of $x$, or fully overlap $x$, and based on that fuzzy_partition divides $A$ into three parts.
**Correctness**
Using induction, assume the algorithm can correctly fuzzy-sort array of size less than $n$. fuzzy_partition divides sized $n$ $A$ into three parts $P_1,P_2,P_3$. Because each interval in $P_2$ overlap with each other, we can find point $x$ in the common intersection. For any interval $[a_{i_j},b_{i_j}]$ in $P_1$, there must exist point $c_j\in [a_{i_j},b_{i_j}]$ satisfying $c_j\le x$. Samewise for any interval in $P_3$ there exist point $x \le c_j$. After fuzzy_quick_sort sorts $P_1$. We have intervals $i_1,i_2,...,i_j,...,i_{|P_1|}$ such that there exist $c_j\in i_j$ satisfying $c_1\le c_2\le ... \le c_{|P_1|}<x$. Then after fuzzy_quick_sort sorts $P_3$. We have intervals $i_{|P_1+P_2|+1},...,i_j,...,i_n$ such that there exist $c_j\in i_j$ satisfying $x<c_{|P_1+P_2|+1}\le ... \le c_n$. Combining those we get $i_1,...,i_j,...,i_n$ such that there exist $c_j\in i_j$ satisfying $c_1\le ... \le c_n$.

b.
By not sorting fuzzy intervals with respect to pivot, each time we may reduce the problem size for recursive calls. Because normal quicksort takes expected $\Theta(n\log{n})$ time, fuzzy quicksort will take no more than that time.
When all of the intervals overlap with each other, fuzzy_partition only gets called one time and returns pair (p,r). Recursive calls to fuzzy_quick_sort return instantly. Total running time is basically the one-time find-intersection plus partition effort $\Theta(n)$.
