By keeping a flag that indicates to the [p,i] portion or [i+1,j-1] portion next encountering element that equals pivot belongs. Flip the flag everytime such element occurs.

Show that in the recurrence
$$
T(n)=\max_{0\leq q\leq n-1}(T(q)+T(n-q-1))+\Theta(n),
$$
$T(n)=\Omega(n^2)$.

Need to prove there exists some $c$ and $m$, that
$$
T(n)\geq cn^2,\quad \forall n \geq m.
$$
Assume inequality true for $0\leq q\leq n-1$, substitute in recurrence we get
$$
T(n)\geq \max_{0\leq q\leq n-1}(cq^2+c(n-q-1)^2)+\Theta(n)\\
=c\max_{0\leq q\leq n-1}(q^2+(n-q-1)^2)+\Theta(n)\\
=c(n-1)^2+\Theta(n)\\
=cn^2-2cn+c^2+\Theta(n).
$$
Choose $c$ small enough that
$$\Theta(n)\geq 2cn,$$
and
$$T(n)\geq cn^2.$$
For base case $T(1)=1$, inequality holds true for any $c\leq 1$. Therefore $T(n)=\Omega(n^2)$.

Show that quicksort's best-case running time is $\Omega(n\log n)$.
For best-case running time we have recurrence
$$
T(n)=\min_{0\leq q\leq n-1}(T(q)+T(n-q-1))+\Theta(n),
$$
Make a guess that there exists some $c$ and $m$, that
$$
T(n)\geq cn\log n,\quad \forall n \geq m.
$$
Assume $T(n)\geq cn\log n$ true for $0\leq q\leq n-1$, substitute in recurrence we get
$$
T(n)\geq c\min_{0\leq q\leq n-1}(q\log q+(n-q-1)\log(n-q-1))+\Theta(n)\\
=c\frac{n}{2}\log{\frac{n}{2}}+c(\frac{n}{2}-1)\log(\frac{n}{2}-1)+\Theta(n)\\
=...
$$

In theory, if we ignore the constant factors, we need to solve
$$ n\log n\geq n\log n+nk-n\log k\\
\log k\geq k,$$
which is not possible for $k>=2$.
If we add the constant factors, we get
$$
c_qn\log n\geq c_qn\log n+c_ink-c_qn\log k\\
\log k\geq\frac{c_i}{c_q} k,
$$
which indicates there might be a good solution. Furthermore, lower-order terms might also t=be taken into considerations.
In pratice, $k$ should be chosen by experiment.
