# Red-Black Trees
* Property 1: node is either balck or red.
* Property 2: root node is black.
* Property 3: leaf T.nil is black.
* Property 4: no two adjacent red nodes.
* Property 5: Starting from each node downwards, all simple paths to its descendant leaf nodes have same black height.
### 13.3 Insertion
### 13.3-5
Consider a red-black tree formed by inserting n nodes with RB-INSERT. Argue that if n>1, the tree has at least one red node.
* z is red, and not root.
* case 1: z.p is black and inserting z does not violate property 4.
* case 2: z.p is red. RB_INSERT_FIXUP leaves node z as is. (Except for one occasion where z rotates with z.p then former z.p becomes new z)
Therefore tree at least has one red node z.

**Solution:**
### 13.3-6
Suggest how to implement RB-INSERT efficiently if the representation for red-black trees includes no storage for parent pointers.
**Solution:**
Case 1: we pop z.p and z.p.p
Case 2: we pop z.p and z.p.p then push back z.p.p and z
Case 3: we pop z.p, z.p.p and z.p.p.p
