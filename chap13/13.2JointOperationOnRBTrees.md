a. 
a1. Initialize T.bh = 0. To think that in any case of RB_INSERT_FIXUP/RB_DELETE_FIXUP, rotation won't affect T.bh. Otherwise property 5 -- for any node in tree all its simple paths to leaves should have the same black-height -- will be violated. The only chance RB_INSERT/RB_DELETE has to change T.bh is when
* RB_INSERT: if in the last step the root in red, we increase T.bh by 1.
* RB_DELETE: if in the last step x is T.root and x is in fact double-black, we decrease T.bh by 1.

a2. Starting from T.root and descending through T, black-height of each node x is either equal to or one less than its parent, depending on x's color.

$$
x.bh=
\begin{cases}
x.p.bh,\quad \rm{x\space is\space Red}\\
x.p.bh-1,\quad\rm{x\space is\space Black}
\end{cases}
$$

b. Start from T1.root and go right if the node has a right child, otherwise go left, until first balck node whose black-height = T2.bh is met.
c. For any $z\in(T_1-T_y)$, $z.key < y.key$. Make $T_y$ the left subtree of $x$, $t_2$ the right subtree of $x$, then we get $T_x$. Use $T_x$ to replace $T_y$ in $T_1$. Because $\forall x_1\in{T_1}, \forall{x_2}\in{T_2}, x1.key < x < x2.key$, 

$$
z.key < y.key < x.key < x2.key,
$$

satisfy binary earch tree property.
d. Red. Use RB_INSERT_FIXUP(T1,x), which iteratively goes up two level to x.p.p until x.p is Black. It takes at most O($\log{n}$) time.
e. Symmetric.
f. Total time is three parts combined: O($\log{n}$) + O(1) + O($\log{n}$) = O($\log{n}$).
