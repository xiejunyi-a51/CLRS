Let $A[1..n]$ be an array of $n$ distinct numbers. If $i < j$ and $A[i] > A[j]$, then the pair $(i, j)$ is called an **_inversion_** of $A$.
**a.** List the five inversions in the array $\langle 2, 3, 8, 6, 1 \rangle$.
**b.** What array with elements from the set $\\{1, 2, \ldots, n\\}$ has the most inversions? How many does it have?
**c.** What is the relationship between the running time of insertion sort and the number of inversions in the input array? Justify your answer.
**d.** Give an algorithm that determines the number of inversions in any permutation of $n$ elements in $\Theta(n\lg n)$ worst-case time. ($\textit{Hint:}$ Modify merge sort).

**Solution:**
a. (2, 1)  (3, 1)  (8, 6)  (8, 1)  (6, 1)
b. the array in descending order，totally $n(n-1)/2$ inversions。
c. 
Everytime we insert an element $A[i]$，we have to
1. Find the position $p$ to insert in ordered subarray. Assume there are $x_i$ elements bigger than $A[i]$ in $A[1..i-1]$.
2. Move every element starting from $p$ one position to the left. $x_i$ elements require moving.
3. put $A[i]$ in $p$, takes $\Theta(1)$.

Therefore it takes $\Theta(x)$ time for every element inserted. 
All $x_i$ sum up to the number of inversions in $A$。That is, the asymptotic running time of insertion sort is proportional to inversions.

d. 
```C++
MERGE_SORT(A, i, j):

    if (i >= j): 
        return 0
    mid = (i+j) / 2
    r1 = MERGE_SORT(i, mid)
    r2 = MERGE_SORT(mid+1, j)
    r3 = MERGE(A, i, j)
    return r1 + r2 + r3

MERGE(A, i, j):

    mid = (i+j) / 2
    p1 = i
    p2 = mid
    index = 0
    r = 0
    while p1 <= mid and p2 <= j
        if A[p1] <= A[p2]:
            res[index++] = A[p1]
        else:
            r += (mid-p1+1)
            res[index++] = A[p2]
    p = p1 > mid ? 0 : p1
    while p <= j:
        res[index++] = a[p]
    return r

```
