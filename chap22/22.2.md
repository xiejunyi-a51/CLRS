**Solution:**
Start with any node $s$, do BFS(DFS) to traverse each node and assign colors "bad" and "good", no two adjacent nodes can have same color. After one traversal, examine each edge, if it connects two vertices with same coloring. If Any edge connecting two same coloring nodes, the graph is not bipartite.
Rational:
Assume in this traversal, two adjacent nodes $u$ and $v$ have same color and violate the rule. Their distance from source $s$ must be some $|u.d-v.d|=2k, k\ge 0$. If we were to fix them and assign them different colors. $s.color$ derived from them would be conflicting. Therefore no other traversal of this graph can lead to successful biparrition.

### 22.2-8
**Solution:**
Proposed algorithm, run BFS once from any source node $s$ and select most faraway node $x$. $x$ must be one of the endpoints of path that consititute diameter of tree. Start from $x$ and run BFS again, we get the other endpoint.
Correctness:
Suppose $a$ and $b$ are the endpoints of path of diameter $\delta(a,b)$ and they are unique. The shortest path distance from $s$ to $a$ is $\delta(s,a)$ and from $s$ to $b$, $\delta(s,b)$. We have

$$
\delta(a,b) \le \delta(s,a) + \delta(s,b).
$$

If $x$ is neither $a$ or $b$, we can replace part of the diameter path and get larger diameter:

$$
\delta(x,s)+\delta(s,b)>\delta(s,a) + \delta(s,b) \ge \delta(a,b),
$$

which conflicts with $a$, $b$ being diameter endpoints. Therefore $x$ is either $a$ or $b$.
