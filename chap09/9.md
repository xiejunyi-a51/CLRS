### 9.1-1
Show that the second smallest of $n$ elements can be found with $n + \lceil \lg n \rceil - 2$ comparisons in the worst case. ($\textit{Hint:}$ Also find the smallest element.)
**Solution:**
Find the smallest in a tournament fasion. And we know the second smallest element is one of the elements that compared with the smallest but lost. We can keep track of the information by for each element maintaining a list of elements lost to it.


### 9.1-2
Prove the lower bound of $\lceil 3n / 2 \rceil - 2$ comparisons in the worst case to find both the maximum and minimum of $n$ numbers. ($\textit{Hint:}$ Consider how many numbers are potentially either the maximum or minimum, and investigate how a comparison affects these counts.)
**Solution:**
1. First compare every two adjacent numbers $a_i,a_{i+1},i=1,3,...$ . Each compare will disqualify one number from being smallest and another from being largest. $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ comparisons leave one group of possible smallest numbers $A$ and one group possible largest $B$.
2. Now for $A$, further comparisions will invalidate one number as smallest at a time. Samewise for $B$. Together, it takes $n-2$ comparisons to find the minimum and maximum. Therefore lower bound is $\lceil 3n / 2 \rceil - 2$.
