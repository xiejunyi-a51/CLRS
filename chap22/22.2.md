### 22.2-7 ⭐
**Solution:**
Start with any node $s$, do BFS(DFS) to traverse each node and assign colors "bad" and "good", no two adjacent nodes can have same color. After one traversal, examine each edge, if it connects two vertices with same coloring. If Any edge connecting two same coloring nodes, the graph is not bipartite.
Rational:
Assume in this traversal, two adjacent nodes $u$ and $v$ have same color and violate the rule. Their distance from source $s$ must be some $|u.d-v.d|=2k, k\ge 0$. If we were to fix them and assign them different colors. $s.color$ derived from them would be conflicting. Therefore no other traversal of this graph can lead to successful biparrition.

**Solution:**
There is exactly one path between any two vertices in tree. That is through lowest common ancestor. See LeetCode #543.
