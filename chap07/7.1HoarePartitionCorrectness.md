Loop Invariant: At the start of each loop, 
1. $i < j$.
2. $\forall k\in [p,i],A[k]\leq x$.
3. $\forall k\in [j,r], A[k]\geq x$.

Init: before first loop, no element is in range $[p, i]$ or $[j, r]$, invariant is trivially fulfilled.
Maintain: function has not returned, it must be $i < j$. After executing line 5 to 7, for $j < k\leq r$, $A[k]>x$; $A[j]\leq x$. And after line 8 to 10, we have $p \leq k < i, A[k] < x$; $A[i]\geq x$. Now if $i < j$, by exchanging $A[i]$ with $A[j]$, invariant is restored. Otherwise algo exits.
Exit: $j\leq i$, thanks to invariant at the beginning of this round of loop, we can derive that array $x$ is successfully partitioned into two parts and loop exited:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A[k]\leq x, \quad &\forall k\in[p, j], \\
A[k]\geq x, \quad &\forall k\in[j+1, r].
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore HORE_PARTITION is correct.
b.
$j$ can never be less than $p$ which is guaranteed by line 7: $A[p]$ must be less than or equal to $x$.
Assume $i$ access over $r$. At the beginning of this loop, 
1. $i < j$.
2. $\forall k\in [p,i],A[k]\leq x$.
3. $\forall k\in [j,r], A[k]\geq x$.

Since $i$ forwards through to $r+1$, it must be $A[k] < x, i+1\leq k\leq r$, 
which is only possible if at the beginning of this loop, $j=r+1$, indicating first round of loop. But in the forst round, increment of $i$ will stop at $p$. Here is a conflict therefore $i$ can never be over $r$.
c.
$j$ is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to $p$ in b. If when exiting $j=r$, possible only in round 1, and $i=j=r$, not possible in first round. Therefore $p\leq j < r$.
d.
Reassured by exiting condition: 

$$
\forall k\in [p, i], A[k]\leq x, \\
\forall k\in [j, r], A[k]\geq x.
$$

e.
```C++
quick_sort(A, p, r):
if p<r:

    q = HOARE_PARTITION(A,p,r)
    quick_sort(A,p,q)
    quick_sort(A,q+1,r)

```
