### 10.4-2
Write an $O(n)$-time recursive procedure that, given an $n$-node binary tree, prints out the key of each node in the tree.

**Solution:**
```C++
traverseTree(x):
    if not x:
        return
    traverseTree(x.left)
        print x
    traverseTree(x.right)
```


### 10.4-3
Write an O$(n)$-time nonrecursive procedure that, given an $n$-node binary tree, prints out the key of each node in the tree. Use a stack as an auxiliary data structure.

**Solution:**
```C++
traverseTreePreOrder(T):
    stack = [T.root]
    while not stack.empty():
        x = stack.pop()
        print x
        if x.right:
            stack.push(x.right)
        if x.left:
            stack.push(x.left)
```

```C++
traverseTreeInOrder(T):
    x = T.root
    while x or not stack.empty():
        if x:
            stack.push(x)
            x = x.left
        else:
            x = stack.pop()
            print x
            x = x.right
```

```C++
get_predessor(x):
    precessor = x.left
        while predessor.right:
            predessor = predessor.right
morris(T):
    x = T.root
    while x:
        if x.left
            precessor = get_precessor(x)
            if not precessor:
                predessor.right = x
                x = x.left
            else:
                predessor.right = nullptr
                print x
                x = x.right
        else:
            print x
            x = x.right
```

### 10.4-4
Write an $O(n)$-time procedure that prints all the keys of an arbitrary rooted tree with $n$ nodes, where the tree is stored using the left-child, right-sibling representation.

**Solution:**
```C++
traverseTreeLeftChildRightSiblingRep(x):
    // recursive, pre-order
    if not x:
        return
    print x
    traverseTreeLeftChildRightSiblingRep(x.left_child)
    while x.right_sibling:
        traverseTreeLeftChildRightSiblingRep(x.right_sibling)
        x = x.right_sibling
```
```C++
traverseTreeLeftChildRightSiblingRep(T):
    //non-recursive, depth-first, pre-order
    stack = [T.root]
    while not stack.empty():
        x = stack.pop()
        print x
        x = x.left_child
        while x:
            stack.push(x)
            x = x.right_sibling
```
### 10.4-5
Write an $O(n)$-time nonrecursive procedure that, given an $n$-node binary tree, prints out the key of each node. Use no more than constant extra space outside of the tree itself and do not modify the tree, even temporarily, during the procedure.

**Solution:**
```C++
traverseTreePreOrder(T):
    x = T.root
    prev = nullptr
    while x:
        if prev == x.parent:
            print x
            x = x.left ? x.left : (x.right ? x.right : x.parent)
        else if prev = x.left:
            x = x.right ? x.right : x.parent
        else:
            x = x.parent
        prev = x
```

### 10.4-6
The left-child, right-sibling representation of an arbitrary rooted tree uses three pointers in each node: _left-child_, _right-sibling_, and _parent_. From any node, its parent can be reached and identified in constant time and all its children can be reached and identified in time linear in the number of children. Show how to use only two pointers and one boolean value in each node so that the parent of a node or all of its children can be reached and identified in time linear in the number of children.

**Solution:**
Get rid of _parent_ pointer in every node. Use boolean to denote the rightmost sibling in a row. Replace its null _right-sibling_ pointer with a pointer that points to the parent.
