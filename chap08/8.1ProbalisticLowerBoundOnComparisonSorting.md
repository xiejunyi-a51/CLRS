a.
Each permutation of $A$'s input will take a decision path to one distinctive leaf. Suppose two different permutation <$a_1,a_2,...,a_n$> and <$b_1,b_2,...,b_n$> lead to the same leaf <$\pi(1),\pi(2),..,\pi(n)$>. Because the input elements are distinct, we can deduce input by placing the smallest, then the 2-nd smallest, then ... element into indicated positions $\pi(1)$, $\pi(2)$,... in order. Thus we have <$a_1,a_2,...,a_n$> and <$b_1,b_2,...,b_n$> is the same which conflicts with assumption. Therefore there will be exactly $n!$ leaves labeled with probability $\frac{1}{n!}$

b.
$$
\begin{aligned}
D(T)&=\sum_{\text{leaf }i\in{T}}\text{depth}(T,i)\\
&=\sum_{\text{leaf }i\in{LT}}\text{depth}(T,i)+\sum_{\text{leaf }i\in{RT}}\text{depth}(T,i)\\
&=\sum_{\text{leaf }i\in{LT}}(\text{depth}(LT,i)+1)+\sum_{\text{leaf }i\in{RT}}(\text{depth}(RT,i)+1)\\
&=D(LT)+D(RT)+k
\end{aligned}
$$

c.
$D(LT)$ is independent of $D(RT)$ once their number of leaves are fixed.
$$
\begin{aligned}
d(k)&=\min\{D(T)\}\\
&=\min_{i=1\to{k-1}}\{D(LT)+D(RT)+k\}\\
&=\min_{i=1\to{k-1}}\{\min\{D(LT)\}+\min\{D(RT)\}+k\}\\
&=\min_{i=1\to{k-1}}\{d(i)+d(k-i)+k\}
\end{aligned}
$$

d.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}(i\lg i + (k - i) \lg(k - i))}{\mathrm{d}i}&=\lg i+\frac{i\lg{e}}{i}-(k-i)\lg(k-i)-\frac{(k-i)\lg{e}}{k-i}\\
&=\lg{i}-(k-i)\lg(k-i),
\end{aligned}
$$
which is a monotonically increasing function and zeroed at $i=k/2$. Therefore $\min\{i\lg i + (k - i) \lg(k - i)\}=k\lg(k/2)$.
Prove $d(k)=\Omega(k\lg{k})$ using **Substitution**:
Suppose $d(i)\ge ci\lg{i}$ for ${i=1\to{k-1}}$. Then
$$
\min_{i=1\to{k-1}}\{d(i)+d(k-i)+k\}\\
\ge\min_{i=1\to{k-1}}\{ci\lg{i}+c(k-i)\lg(k-i)\}+k\\
=c\cdot \min_{i=1\to{k-1}}\{i\lg{i}+(k-i)\lg(k-i)\}+k\\
=ck\lg(k/2)+k\\
=ck\lg{k}+k(1-c)\\
\ge{ck\lg{k}},\quad c\le 1.
$$
Base case $d(1)=0$.
$d(k)=\Omega(k\lg{k})$.

e. 
Prove that $D(T_A) = \Omega(n!\lg(n!))$, and conclude that the average-case time to sort $n$ elements is $\Omega(n\lg n)$.

$D(T_A)\ge d(k_A)=\Omega(n!\lg(n!))$.
Expected time to sort $n$ elements is expected depth of leaf of $T_A$. Since each reachable leaf has probability of $1/n!$, their average depth is at least $d(k_A)/n!=\Omega(\lg(n!))=\Omega(n\lg{n})$.

Now, consider a _randomized_ comparison sort $B$. We can extend the decision-tree model to handle randomization by incorporating two kinds of nodes: ordinary comparison nodes and "randomization" nodes. A randomization node models a random choice of the form $\text{RANDOM}(1, r)$ made by algorithm $B$; the node has $r$ children, each of which is equally likely to be chosen during an execution of the algorithm.

f. 
Show that for any randomized comparison sort $B$, there exists a deterministic comparison sort $A$ whose expected number of comparisons is no more than those made by $B$.

If in $B$ from bottom up, for each random node we choose the path leading to minimum subtree expected path length, the resulting deterministic $A$ must have expected number of comparisons no more than $B$.
