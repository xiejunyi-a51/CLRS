Suppose that the $n$ records have keys in the range from 1 to $k$. Show how to modify counting sort so that it sorts the records in place in $\text{O}(n+k)$ time. You may use $\text{O}(k)$ storage outside the input array. Is your algorithm stable? 

**Solution:**
In counting sort, $C$ records the number of keys smaller than or equal to each particular item. Modify $C$ so that resulting $B$ knows the start position for each key $k$ if it exists:
$$
B[k]=C[k-1]+1.
$$
Range for each key $k$ then becomes
$$
[B[k],B[k+1]-1].
$$
Make $C=B$.
Going through items $A[i]$ in input array, in the meantime maintain a pointer to the range so that $B[k]\le i\le C[k]$. If $A[i]\neq k$, swap $A[i]$ with $C[k]$ and increase $C[k]$ by one, until $A[i]=k$.
```C++
InplaceSort1Tok(A,k,n):
    // make C[1..k] = 0
    // make B[1..k] = 0
    for a in A:
        C[a] = C[a] + 1
    for i = 2 to k:
        C[i] = C[i] + C[i-1]
    for i = 2 to k:
        B[i] = C[i-1] + 1
    B[1] = 1
    C = B
    j = 1
    key = 1
    while i <= n:
        if A[i] != key:
            swap A[i] with A[C[key]]
            C[key] = C[key] + 1
            continue
        { // B[j] <= i <= B[j+1]-1
        i ++ 
        if i <= n and i > B[j+1]-1:
            j = j + 1
            key = B[j]
        }
```
**Correctness:**
    The description of the algorithm states its correctness. While iterating thought $A$, we make sure each item is of the key expected before move forward.
    The algorithm is in place but not stable.
**Complexity:**
    Three loops from line 26 to line 31 takes $\text{O}(n+k)=\text{O}(n)$ time.
    To examine running time for while loop starting from line 36, notice each line 38 basic swap operation puts a record at its right position and therefore it can be executed at most $n$ times, which is also the number of times line 37 evaluates to be false. 
    Block line 41 to line 46 will be runned exactly $n$ times which is the number of times line 37 evaluates to be true. Together, algorithm takes $\text{O}(n)$ linear time.
